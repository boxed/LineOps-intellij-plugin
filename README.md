LineOps
=======================

An IntelliJ plugin for line operations based on bookmarks. If you've ever used TextPad this should be familar, if not, then look at the feature list:

- Bookmark all lines matching a string
- Remove bookmark for all lines matching a string
- Invert bookmarks (i.e. bookmark all non-bookmarked lines and un-bookmark all non-bookmarked lines)
- Cut/copy/delete all bookmarked lines


These set operations create a really powerful way to filter out log files or similar long line-based data.
